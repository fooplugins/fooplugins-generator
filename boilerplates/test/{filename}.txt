This is the generated output which showcases what the generator can do

Simple Variable Substitution
============================
If you enter a {variable} in the file and it is declared in foogen_boilerplate.php, then it will be replaced with the value you entered in the form.
For example, in this test generator, 3 variables are declared in foogen_boilerplate.php ("name", "title", "filename")
For "Name", you entered "{name}"

Function Variable Substitutions
===============================
You can also call functions when performing the substitution
For example {variable:func} will substitute the value of "variable" after it has been passed through function "func"
There are some built-in functions that can be used:
* {variable:lowercase} - make the variable lowercase - eg. {name:lowercase}
* {variable:uppercase} - make the variable uppercase - eg. {name:uppercase}
* {variable:slugify} - make the variable safe for use as a slug - eg. {name:slugify}
* {variable:class} - make the variable safe for use as a class name - eg. {name:class}
* {variable:constant} - make the variable safe for use as a constant - eg. {name:constant}
* {variable:filename} - make the variable safe for use as a filename - eg. {name:filename}
* {variable:function} - make the variable safe for use as a function name - eg. {name:function}

Filename Substitution
=====================
You can use {variables} in filenames too.
Also, filenames ending in .php.txt will be renamed automatically to .php

Conditional Blocks
==================
Conditional blocks will be included if the variable has a value. For example:
{#if variable}
This line will only be included if "variable" has a value
This applies to any number of lines between the #if and #endif
{#endif variable}

If you entered a Title, then it will show in a block below. If not, then you will not see the line at all.
{#if title}
------------------------------------------------------
This block would not have shown if the title was blank
For "Title", you entered "{title}"
------------------------------------------------------
{#endif title}
